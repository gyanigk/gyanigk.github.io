My First Work Expierence is in around the Appearance Based Gaze Estimation using simple webcam technology. The problem statement is not easy as there has been decades of research poured into this field.
This is my first internship and that to be at IISc, which has given me first-hand introduction to research like writing meaningful scripts/apps for softwares, implementing new ideas, testing and validating at each step of the experimentation, writing paper, basic undertanding in different types of publications submissions like conference, working-in-progress, journals, etc. It is quite a long race in achieving the goals of any research, so having patience and perverance is of the essence.
