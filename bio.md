Hi, I am a Gyanig Kumar, pursuing my master's study at University of Colorado, Boulder in Computer Science. I worked as Research Assistant at Intelligent Inclusive Interaction Design (I3D) Lab, IISc Bangalore under Prof. Pradipta Biswas.
Ongoing: I am still figuring out a unique problem in Computer Vision to approach towards and work towards that. Hit me up for collaborations. 
I am a part-time graduate studies teacher for mathematics 1 and 2 at PTC, Suriname. I participate in teaching, mentoring and building learning modules for students.

When I take breaks, my favourite things are to play guitar, click pictures, would like to build small robotics stuff automating my room, basically average hobbyist guy.
