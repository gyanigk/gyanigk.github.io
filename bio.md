Hi, I am a Gyanig Kumar, with bachleor degree in Computer Science and Systems Engineering. I am currently Research Assistant at Intelligent Inclusive Interaction Design (I3D) Lab, IISc Bangalore under Prof. Pradipta Biswas.
Ongoing: My research interests are in Object Detection and Tracking, Multi-modal Learning, Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation in 2D/3D, Deep Learning methodalogies and Problem Solving. Apart from the mentioned, I actively pursue interests in Monocular Depth Estimation, low-computation and faster Landmark Detection library, Open-source Gaze estimation Library and Music compositions.
I always dedicate my time to solving problems in the focus of Computer Vision and Human computer Interaction(+Robotics) Research.
I try to keep up with the basics of new learning methodologies like Domain Adaption, Self-Supervised Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Inverse-Reinforcement-Learning, other novel transformer mechanisms quite often by implementing some good papers on my own.  
I am a part-time graduate studies teacher for mathematics 1 and 2 at PTC, Suriname. I am involved in teaching, mentoring and building learning modules for students.

When I take breaks, my favourite things are to play guitar, click pictures, build small robotics stuff automating my room, basically average hobbyist guy.
