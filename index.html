<br>Hi, I am a fourth-year BTech student at <a href="https://kiit.ac.in">KIIT</a>, pursuing Computer Science and Systems Engineering. I am 
	currently interning at <a href="https://cambum.net/I3DLab/projects.htm">Intelligent Inclusive Interaction Design (I3D) Lab, IISc Bangalore</a>
	under <a href="https://cambum.net/PB/">Prof. Pradipta Biswas</a>. I am highly motivated to dedicate my time to solving problems in the focus 
	of Computer Vision and Speech Research. I try to keep up with the basics of new learning methodologies like Domain Adaption, Self-Supervised 
	Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Inverse-Reinforcement-Learning, other novel transformer mechanisms quite often by implementing some good papers on my own.  

<!-- I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish
	Anand</a>.<br><br> -->

When Iâ€™m take breaks, my favourite things are to play guitar, go for a trek in the wild, build small robotics stuff automating my room, explore myself.
